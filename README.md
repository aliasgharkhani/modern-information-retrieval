# modern-information-retrieval
This project has 3 phases and was my "modern information retrieval" course project.
## Phase1
In this phase we should first preprocess text data then index given data(from Wikipedia) to make it possible to quickly search query through it. At the end we should evaluate searh system developed by MAP, F-Measure, R-Precision, and NDCG.
## Phase2
In second phase we should classify and cluster given text data(part of AG News data). For classification we used kNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM. Then for clustering we used K-Means. At the end we analysed results using t-SNE.
The evaluation metrics used were : Recall, Precision, Accuracy, Confusion matrix, and Macro averaged F1.
It also had bonus point section and at that section we should construct a vector for each document using word2vec method
## Phase3
At last phase we were asked to craul researchgate.net website to extract papers data and then use ElasticSearch to index them. After indexing we should calculate page rank of each paper and find top authors using HITS algorithm.
This phase also had bonus point section and that was about learning to rank MQ2008 dataset using Ranking SVM.
